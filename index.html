                <div class="paragraph">The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron tower that stands 1,063 ft (324 m) tall. It was designed for the Exposition Universelle, a world fair held in Paris in 1889. It's currently the most famous symbol of Paris. Two senior engineers working for the architect and engineer Gustave Eiffel designed the Tower, which was then approved by Eiffel and proposed as the centerpiece for the world fair held in France’s capital, the Exposition Universelle in 1889. Once approved, 250 builders were hired to build the monument, which took over two years to finish.

                    Initially, the Eiffel Tower was the subject of controversy. The artists of the period thought the monument to be monstrous, and given its poor profitability, it was suggested on several occasions that they should demolish it.
                    
                    During World War I, enemy messages were intercepted thanks to the tower radiotelegraphy center.
                    
                    Currently, the Eiffel Tower is the most-visited monument in the world with over 7 million visitors a year. This is partly due to the popularity of Paris as a tourist destination.   </div>

                <div class="paragraph">Vietnam is well-recognized for its breathtaking beauty and home to some of the most amazing natural wonders in the world. It is a visual wonderland with everything: from the misty highlands, shimmering rice fields and magical waterfalls of the Northern region like in Sapa, Ha Giang or Ninh Binh, to the sun-kissed sand stretches and brilliant turquoise waters of the Central and Southern beaches like in Phu Quoc, Nha Trang or Da Nang.

                    In addition, Vietnam is a country with a long history and age-old customs. It features numerous ancient temples and historical landmarks. In your Asia travel, you can learn more about Vietnam’s history and culture by paying a visit to Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi, the Imperial Citadel in Hue, Saigon Notre Dame Cathedral and Cu Chi Tunnels in Ho Chi Minh City, or many ancient houses and assembly halls in Hoi An. Furthermore, with a wide array of unique species, Vietnam is one of the most biodiverse countries on the planet. The natural reserves and national parks of Vietnam are incredibly diverse and stretch over the three regions of the country. Some famous places are Phu Quoc National Park, Ben En National Park, Bach Ma National Park, Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park, etc.
